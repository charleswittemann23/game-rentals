## Project from UVA CS 3240 Software Engineering Spring 2025
- Under the instruction of Professor Mark Sheriff
- In collaboration with Jonah Lee and Dawson Johnson


# Role/Responsibilities
This project was originally designed with a team size of 5 students in mind. However, when several members left our team after dropping the class, each of our roles expanded to take on a bigger portion of the project. My technical expertise gained during this project consisted of:
  - Heroku Cloud Deployment of our software
  - AWS S3 compatibility to store our images.
  - Implementation of basic django security features
  - Search implementation features, and other general design features
